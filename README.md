# Green-Watch

Green Watch is an NLP-driven tool designed to help monitor and ensure compliance with environmental regulations in Nigeria. Utilizing officially published environmental regulations, this tool aids chemical plants, environmental agencies, and regulatory bodies in understanding and adhering to legal standards. The project uses Python and NLP technologies to process, analyze, and predict compliance outcomes based on textual data from Nigerian environmental laws.

## About dataset 

The dataset was obtained from the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA) website and manually annotated  

## How it works 

The user uploads the document they want to check, and  then based on the entities and relationships extracted, the system applies predefined rules or criteria to assess whether the document indicates compliance with the relevant regulations.
The system then generates a report detailing areas of compliance and non-compliance, highlighting specific excerpts from the document that support these findings.

## Features

- **Regulation Text Extraction**: Automatically extracts and processes text from official gazettes of environmental regulations.
- **Entity and Relationship Extraction**: Uses NLP to identify key regulatory entities and their relationships.
- **Compliance Checking Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for querying specific regulations and checking compliance statuses.
- **Automated Updates and Alerts**: Regularly updates the database with new regulations and alerts users to significant changes.
